MQ on OpenStack
===============
This repository contains samples for using MQ with OpenStack, as discussed in the following blog entries:

* [./packer](Packer) - [MQ on OpenStack, part one: Creating an image using Packer](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/messaging/entry/mq_openstack_part1_packer?lang=en)
* [./heat](Heat) - [MQ on OpenStack, part two: Managing an MQ environment using Heat](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/messaging/entry/mq_openstack_part2_heat?lang=en)

These samples depend on the use of OpenStack, as well as the OpenStack command line clients, as detailed in each blog entry.
